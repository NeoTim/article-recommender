    Recommender is a simple content recommendation system
  </div>
  <div>
    All you need to do is:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upvote content that was worth your attention and then Recommender will increase the volume of people who recommended it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Downvote any content that wasted your time - and Recommender will reduce the volume of those who upvoted it
      </li>
      <li>
        Just ignore content that you didnâ€™t feel strongly about - and Recommender will gradually lower the volume of those who bring you such content.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
